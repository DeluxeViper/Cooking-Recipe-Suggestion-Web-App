I met a wonderful Hawaiian lady named Nalani at an event here in Maui. She was selling her banana bread. After taking the first bite I knew this was something special. She was so happy with how much I loved her banana bread she happily shared the recipe. Best served warm and fresh from the oven. Aloha!",

It traditionally takes hours to make, as we let the beans slow cook overnight in the oven on low heat. I transformed it into a much quicker Instant Pot recipe with great success! With this method, you don't even have to presoak the beans. These are even better the next day and freeze well, too.",

Normally, \"mojo\" means a flavor based on Seville oranges, and these sour oranges can be hard to find. A bit of extra lime, some grapefruit juice, and vinegar stand in for the brightness of the missing Seville oranges in this recipe. The red pepper flakes add just a little zing, so if you like spicy foods, feel free to add more, to your taste.

The dough is pressed into carved molds that can be used for wall decorations. When turned out onto the cookie sheet, the picture appears as its mirror image, hence the name. In the Sinterklass season they are available in 2/3 cookie size to huge thick men and women up to 1 pound known as lovers. If molds are not available, roll dough to desired thickness and use gingerbread man cutter or other cutter shapes. They are great to make ahead around Christmas because they last a long time.",

We ate the pork (pork roast and kielbasa) because pigs are a symbol of progress. Pigs push forward, rooting themselves in the ground before moving, and we need to move into the New Year in the same way. We eat sauerkraut, as it's believed it will bring blessings and wealth for the new year. It also reminds us that with the good comes the bitter as well.

    "description": "This is my mother's crispy latke recipe. It's been a smashing hit at dozens of Chanukah parties. The secret is in the potatoes, which are crushed rather than grated, resulting in a light, crispy latke. Applesauce and sour cream are favorite accompaniments for these latkes. Make an interesting tuna salad, cut up some veggies, and you have a full meal.",

    "name": "CindyD's Somewhat Southern Fried Chicken",
    "description": "This is how I fry chicken. This recipe shows the ability of Americans in the 21st century to easily obtain food. I was raised by a woman whose grandparents survived the War Between the States and who had lived through both WWII and the Great Depression. She NEVER used an egg to batter anything -- they couldn't afford it then. She coated her chicken with only seasoned flour. The secret to really good fried chicken is to handle as little in the pan as possible and only turn it once.",

They are super easy to put together and taste incredible! Watch out though, because there is nothing low-fat about them! I like to assemble these enchiladas in the morning or night before, come home and pop them in the oven. When cold, add 10 more minutes to the baking time. Leave out the onions for picky eaters.",

    "name": "Vietnamese Beef Pho",
    "description": "This pho lemongrass soup is served with a plate full of fresh garnishes and various sauces \u2014 this allows each person to season their serving to taste. The soup is somewhat unusual because the meat is cooked in the serving bowl. The beef is sliced very thin, almost thin enough to see through; you might want to have the butcher slice it. The boiling hot broth is poured over the noodles and raw meat. The meat is quickly cooked in the hot broth while you garnish the soup.",
